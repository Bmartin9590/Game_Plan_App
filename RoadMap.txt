📌 RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT ORDER

To keep things clean and avoid rewriting:

Step 1 — Finish Authentication + Dashboard

You’re almost done.

Step 2 — Build Canvas v1 (Play Creator)

This is the foundation of everything.

Step 3 — Add Formation Generator + Player Movement

Once the canvas works, all AI play creation can be layered on top.

Step 4 — Build Practice Scripts

Simpler than Game Scripts and will test database structure.

Step 5 — Build Game Scripts

More complex and deeper UI.

Step 6 — Add AI Features

Only after the UI + DB are solid.
